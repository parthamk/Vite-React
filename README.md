# Vite-React
Create React app with Vite, we don't use create-react-app for this.

> What Vite is?
Vite is a build tool that promotes a faster development experience for developers. It was created by Evan You.

> Here are the commands:

npm init vite

We need to add a project and package name, as demonstrated below:

We then need to select React as the framework and variant:

Then

Our project is now created. Let’s install and then run it.

In the terminal, navigate into the generated project. In my case, ViteTutoral and type the command below:

npm install

This command installs the required dev dependencies which you can access from the package.json file.

It also creates a node_modules folder which can be viewed as an external modules’ cache.

Your package.json file should look, as shown below:

Finally, include the following command to start the dev server:

npm run dev

Copy and paste the provided link on your browser. You now have React and Vite running on your local server. Congratulations!
